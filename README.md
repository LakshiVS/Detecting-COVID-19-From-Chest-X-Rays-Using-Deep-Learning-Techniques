# Detecting-COVID-19-From-Chest-X-Rays-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

## Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Medical images and artificial intelligence (AI) play a crucial role in the rapid assessment and treatment of COVID-19 patients. While PCR tests can take several hours, chest X-rays provide immediate information for clinical assessment. If the X-ray is normal, patients can go home while awaiting test results; if not, they are admitted for closer monitoring.

Deep learning methods, particularly high-performance classifiers, have proven effective in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-rays. This project leverages these methods, providing a user-friendly web interface built with Flask and a trained model for accurate detection.

## Key Features

- Rapid COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.
- High-performance classification with deep learning.
- Easy-to-use web interface with Flask.
